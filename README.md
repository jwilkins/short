# Short

Short is a simple URL shortening service written in Ruby, using Sinatra and
DataMapper.

It was originally written by [Dennis Martinez](http://www.dennmart.com/) using
MongoDB and then adapted by Jonathan Rudenberg to use DataMapper. See the
[original repo](http://github.com/dennmart/mongoshort) for docs.
